# NYPD Complaint Clustering Crime
This GitHub repository contains an unsupervised machine learning implementation of various clustering models applied to the NYPD Complaint Data Historic dataset. Our goal is to identify patterns and relationships among the crimes reported to the NYPD in order to provide insights into crime trends and hotspots.

Using techniques such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN, we analyze the dataset to group similar crimes based on various attributes, such as date, time, location, and crime type. By visualizing the results of these clustering models, we can identify distinct crime patterns and potential hotspots, enabling law enforcement agencies to take proactive measures to prevent crimes.

This repository contains the code, data, and results of our clustering analysis, along with documentation and instructions for reproducing the results. We encourage others to build on our work and contribute to the development of more effective crime prevention strategies.

### Features
