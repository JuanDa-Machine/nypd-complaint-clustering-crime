# NYPD Complaint Clustering Crime
This GitHub repository contains an unsupervised machine learning implementation of various clustering models applied to the NYPD Complaint Data Historic dataset by boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyng and Bronx). The goal is to identify patterns and relationships among the crimes reported to the NYPD in order to provide insights into crime trends and hotspots.

Using techniques such as K-means, and K-modes, this work analyzes the dataset to group similar crimes based on various attributes, such as date, time, location, and crime type. By visualizing the results of these clustering models, centroids can be profiled and although the metrics for the modes are not the best, the study still finds a pattern in the reported complaints data enabling law enforcement agencies to take proactive measures to prevent crimes.

This repository contains the code, data, and results for clustering analysis, along with documentation and instructions for reproducing the results. It encourages others to build on this work and contribute to the development of more effective crime prevention strategies.

### Features
